  QTRSensors.h - Library for using Pololu QTR reflectance
	sensors and reflectance sensor arrays: QTR-1A, QTR-8A, QTR-1RC, and 
	QTR-8RC.  The object used will determine the type of the sensor (either
	QTR-xA or QTR-xRC).  Then simply specify in the constructor which 
	Arduino I/O pins are connected to a QTR sensor, and the read() method
	will obtain reflectance measurements for those sensors.  Smaller sensor
	values correspond to higher reflectance (e.g. white) while larger
	sensor values correspond to lower reflectance (e.g. black or a void).
	
	* QTRSensorsRC should be used for QTR-1RC and QTR-8RC sensors.
	* QTRSensorsAnalog should be used for QTR-1A and QTR-8A sensors.

	// Example usage:

	// sensors.read(sensor_values);
	// The values returned are a measure of the reflectance in abstract units,
	// with higher values corresponding to lower reflectance (e.g. a black
	// surface or a void).
	// If measureOffAndOn is true, measures the values with the
	// emitters on AND off and returns on - (timeout - off).  If this
	// value is less than zero, it returns zero.
	// This method will call the appropriate derived class' readPrivate(), as
	// determined by the _type data member.  Making this method virtual
	// leads to compiler warnings, which is why this alternate approach was
	// taken.

	void readCalibrated(unsigned int *sensor_values);

	// Operates the same as read calibrated, but also returns an
	// estimated position of the robot with respect to a line. The

	// multiplied by 1000, so that a return value of 0 indicates that
	// the line is directly below sensor 0, a return value of 1000
	// indicates that the line is directly below sensor 1, 2000
	// indicates that it's below sensor 2000, etc.  Intermediate
	// values indicate that the line is between two sensors.  The
	// formula is:
	// 
	//    0*value0 + 1000*value1 + 2000*value2 + ...

	// By default, this function assumes a dark line (high values)
	// surrounded by white (low values).  If your line is light on
	// black, set the optional second argument white_line to true.  In
	// this case, each sensor value will be replaced by (1000-value)
	// before the averaging.

	// update both of them.
	//
	// The pointers are unallocated until calibrate() is called, and
	// then allocated to exactly the size required.  Depending on the
	// readMode argument to calibrate, only the On or Off values may
	// be allocated, as required.
	//
	// These variables are made public so that you can use them for
	// your own calculations and do things like saving the values to
	// EEPROM, performing sanity checking, etc.
